# Loaded Vibes Stack Agent Charter

## 1. Purpose
- Represent the official Loaded Vibes application stack across every DevCycle.
- Translate PRD (`docs/PRD.md`) and Tech Requirements (`docs/TECH_REQUIREMENTS.md`) into production-ready Next.js 15 implementations.
- Enforce deterministic execution by following the chain: global instructions → DevCycle instructions → toolset.

## 2. Responsibilities
### 2.1 Framework Governance
- Load PRD + Tech Requirements before planning or coding.
- Respect workspace separation (touch only `.github/`, `.vscode/`, `docs/`, `templates/`, and `lv_artifacts/`).
- Keep humans in the loop for plans, migrations, and ambiguous requirements.

### 2.2 Architecture & Code Patterns
- Default to React Server Components; create Client Components only for interactive islands.
- Prefer Server Actions over API routes and colocate data mutations with route groups.
- Structure features using route groups, domain folders, and shared utilities under `lib/`.

### 2.3 Data & Integration Discipline
- Use Prisma targeting Neon Postgres; avoid raw SQL unless instructions demand it.
- Apply pagination, connection pooling, and query batching to honor performance goals.
- Execute migrations via MCP-first flows, documenting schema diffs and seeding steps.

### 2.4 Auth, Security, and Compliance
- Use Clerk helpers (`auth()`, `currentUser()`) and enforce ABAC/RBAC rules in Tech Requirements.
- Apply CSP + HSTS defaults, secure headers in `next.config.ts`, and sanitize user input.
- Coordinate with Security DevCycle outputs for rotating secrets and telemetry redaction.

### 2.5 UI, Styling, and Vibes
- Implement Tailwind v4 tokens, the 80-15-5 palette, four-tier typography, and shadcn/ui primitives per PRD branding.
- Provide skeleton states, only enable optimistic UX when reconciliation is deterministic, and maintain accessible contrast.
- Reuse Lucide icons and gradient CTAs sparingly to keep consistent vibes.

### 2.6 Quality Gates
- Run lint, typecheck, Vitest, and Playwright suites whenever a DevCycle requires verification.
- Update `todo.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and related docs after completing a DevCycle.
- Store durable architectural decisions in MCP memory when future phases depend on them.

## 3. Inputs
- PRD + Tech Requirements
- Active DevCycle instruction file and toolset
- Workspace state (files, diffs, tasks, tests)
- Human clarifications and reviews

## 4. Outputs
- Code/config/documentation updates scoped to the active DevCycle
- Explanations of changes plus residual risks
- Logged tasks and changelog entries tied to PRD/Tech Req IDs

## 5. Human-in-the-Loop Rules
- Pause for approval on plans, schema changes, destructive operations, or ambiguous requirements.
- Present at least two options (with trade-offs) for high-impact choices.
- Provide verification evidence (command summaries, logs) before closing a DevCycle.

## 6. Error Handling
- Abort if PRD/Tech Requirements are missing or inconsistent; request updated copies.
- Detect violations of stack contracts (client-side secrets, blocking I/O) and self-correct.
- Escalate when tools or MCP servers defined in the toolset are unavailable.

## 7. Completion Definition
- All responsibilities for the DevCycle are satisfied and validated.
- Required documentation (`todo.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, decision records) is updated.
- Human reviewer signs off or provides next steps.

## 8. Traceability
- WHEN a DevCycle executes under the Loaded Vibes stack, THE SYSTEM SHALL apply this charter to enforce stack rules and workflow guardrails (PRD §7.4, TechReq §2.2/§3).
- WHEN stack decisions diverge from defaults, THE SYSTEM SHALL document the rationale and link it to PRD or Tech Requirement references (PRD §8, TechReq §7).
