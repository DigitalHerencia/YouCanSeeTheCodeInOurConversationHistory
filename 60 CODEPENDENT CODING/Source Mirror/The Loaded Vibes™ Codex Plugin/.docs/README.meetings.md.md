## Workflow Patterns

### Daily Context Flow

```text
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Previous Day       │
│  Meeting Pages      │
├─────────────────────┤
│ • "Today" section   │───▶ Becomes "Yesterday" in new meeting
│ • Unresolved blocks │───▶ Carry forward to "Blockers"
│ • Open action items │───▶ Check status or carry forward
└─────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Tasks Database     │
├─────────────────────┤
│ • Due today         │───▶ Populate "Today" section
│ • High priority     │───▶ Add to "Action items"
│ • Overdue           │───▶ Flag in "Blockers"
└─────────────────────┘
         │
         ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  Projects Database  │
├─────────────────────┤
│ • Current phase     │───▶ Context for task priority
│ • Sprint timeline   │───▶ Deadline awareness
│ • Team assignment   │───▶ Ownership clarity
└─────────────────────┘
```

### Biweekly Sprint Cycle

```text
Day 1-2: Sprint Planning
  └─ Set sprint goal
  └─ Commit backlog items
  └─ Assign team roles

Days 3-12: Daily Execution
  └─ Daily Standups (cross-team)
  └─ Domain meetings (per-team)
  └─ Weekly Sync (mid-sprint)

Day 13-14: Sprint Close
  └─ Post-mortem
  └─ Carry learnings → Next Sprint Planning
```

## Copilot Execution Instructions

### When Filling Out Today's Daily Standup

```python
# Pseudocode for Copilot context gathering

1. QUERY yesterday's Daily Standup page
   - Extract "What are we doing today?" items
   - Mark completed items with ✓
   - Carry incomplete items forward

2. QUERY Tasks database
   - Filter: due = today AND done = false
   - Group by team relation
   - Format as bullet list

3. QUERY Projects database
   - Filter: team in today's attendees AND status = "Active"
   - Include phase and timeline context

4. COMPOSE meeting content
   - Yesterday: {completed items from step 1}
   - Today: {tasks from step 2 + project continuations}
   - Blockers: {unresolved from yesterday + new}
   - Actions: {high-priority tasks as to-dos}

5. UPDATE meeting page via MCP
   - Use patch-block-children to append content
   - Link action items to Tasks DB if possible
```

### When Filling Out Sprint Planning

```python
1. QUERY previous Post-mortem
   - Extract "Future Work" and "Action Items"
   - Use learnings to inform sprint goal

2. QUERY Projects database
   - Filter: status = "Active" AND phase upcoming
   - List all committed project phases

3. QUERY Teams database
   - Get all active teams
   - Document roles for each

4. COMPOSE Sprint Planning content
   - Goal: {derived from OKRs + post-mortem}
   - Backlog: {projects from step 2 in standard format}
   - Teams: {from step 3}
   - Notes: {risks, dependencies, constraints}
```

## MCP Tool Usage for Meetings

### Querying Today's Meetings

```bash
Tool: query-data-source
Data Source ID: {{registry.databases.meetings.id}}
Filter: { "property": "Created", "date": { "equals": "{today}" } }
```

### Getting Meeting Content

```bash
Tool: get-block-children
Block ID: {meeting page ID}
```

### Updating Meeting Content

```bash
Tool: patch-block-children
Block ID: {meeting page ID}
Children: [
  { "type": "bulleted_list_item", "bulleted_list_item": { "rich_text": [...] } }
]
```
