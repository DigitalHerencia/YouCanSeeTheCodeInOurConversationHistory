# Vouch Implementation Instructions

> Reference-only Vouch implementation instructions. They are not active repository governance.

## Operating Mode

Treat Vouch as a production SaaS codebase with strict source-of-truth contracts.

Do not improvise product scope.

Do not add convenience surfaces that violate the Vouch product boundary.

Smallest correct surface wins.

Vouch is a narrow commitment-backed payment coordination system.

Vouch is not:

- marketplace
- broker
- scheduler
- messaging app
- review/rating system
- dispute-resolution system
- escrow provider
- discovery platform
- admin arbitration surface

## Source Order

Use this authority order:

1. `.agents/docs/*.md`
2. `.agents/contracts/*.yaml`
3. `.agents/instructions/*.agents.md`
4. existing repo code
5. agent judgment

If code conflicts with docs or contracts, docs/contracts win.

If contracts conflict with docs, stop and report the contradiction before implementing.

If instructions conflict with docs or contracts, docs/contracts win.

Do not invent behavior to resolve contradictions.

## Before Changing Code

Before changing any file:

1. Identify the smallest surface of change.
2. Identify affected route/page/feature/action/fetcher/transaction/integration/schema/type/DTO/component.
3. Read relevant contracts.
4. Read relevant docs.
5. Inspect existing repo code.
6. Make the smallest conforming change.
7. Output complete affected files.

## Output Rule

When asked for implementation code:

- output complete affected files
- no snippets
- no partial patches
- no ellipses
- no pseudo-code
- no summary-only implementation

If a file changes, provide the whole file.

If blocked, provide the most complete compilable blocked-state file possible and state the exact missing context.

## App Router Rule

Route files stay thin.

Allowed in `app/**` route files:

- metadata
- params/searchParams handoff
- redirects when required
- Suspense boundary
- feature composition
- skeleton fallback
- static public page assembly

Forbidden in `app/**` route files:

- Prisma imports
- Stripe SDK imports
- domain mutations
- business transactions
- protected DTO shaping
- settlement logic
- provider reconciliation
- complex form logic

Correct pattern:

```txt
app page
-> Suspense if dynamic
-> page feature
-> skeleton
```

## Feature Rule

Server features may:

- orchestrate fetchers
- pass DTOs
- perform role-aware composition
- hand actions to client components

Server features must not:

- mutate provider state
- mutate database state directly
- call Prisma directly
- call Stripe SDKs directly

Client features may handle:

- drawer/dialog state
- form state
- transition state
- optimistic display where safe
- button interactions
- copy/share behavior

Client features must not create truth.

## Component Rule

Components may:

- render DTOs
- render content module data
- render presentational layout
- render buttons, panels, cards, badges, drawers, summaries

Components must not:

- call Prisma
- call Stripe SDKs
- call Clerk server APIs
- perform protected fetching
- perform domain mutations
- decide settlement
- own authorization truth
- own confirmation truth
- hard-code repeated long-form copy

## Read Pattern

Protected reads go through fetchers.

```txt
lib/fetchers/*
-> require active user
-> authorize access
-> use minimal select
-> map DTO
-> declare cache policy
-> return transport-safe data
```

Fetchers must not mutate state.

Fetchers must not return raw Prisma, Stripe, Clerk, webhook, identity, card, or bank objects.

## Write Pattern

Protected writes go through server actions.

```txt
lib/actions/*
-> require active user
-> authorize action
-> parse input with Zod
-> retrieve provider state if needed
-> call integration if needed
-> call transaction helper
-> write audit event
-> revalidate
-> return typed ActionResult or redirect
```

Server actions must not trust client state for:

- confirmation
- payment
- settlement
- readiness
- role
- fee math

## Stripe Pattern

All Stripe SDK calls live under:

```txt
lib/integrations/stripe/*
```

Before settlement-critical operations:

```txt
retrieve current PaymentIntent
compare provider state to local workflow state
apply only valid forward movement
use durable idempotency key
persist normalized provider result
write audit event
```

Never capture, cancel, void, or refund from stale local state alone.

Never finalize payment state from browser return.

Never use direct charges as canonical Vouch flow.

Never use invoice/product/price catalog flows for individual Vouches.

Vouch uses manual-capture PaymentIntents for Vouch payment authorization.

Stripe owns payment truth.

Vouch owns workflow truth.

## Clerk Pattern

All Clerk authentication access is centralized under:

```txt
lib/auth/*
```

All Vouch permission checks are centralized under:

```txt
lib/authz/*
```

Clerk session proves authentication.

Database state proves Vouch permissions.

Clerk must not decide:

- Vouch participation
- payment readiness
- payout readiness
- settlement
- confirmation validity
- Vouch role by metadata alone

The Clerk webhook handler must remain a webhook handler.

Keep `/api/clerk/webhooks` as the canonical provider webhook route.

## Confirmation Pattern

Confirmation actions must enforce:

- active user
- participant authorization
- open confirmation window
- valid role
- valid code derivation
- no duplicate confirmation
- server-side timestamp
- offline payload validity if applicable

One-sided confirmation never releases funds.

Late confirmation never releases funds.

Manual/system/support confirmation must not exist.

GPS is not settlement truth.

Screenshots/evidence must not influence settlement.

If both confirmations are valid inside the window, settlement evaluation may run.

If not, no settlement.

## Dashboard Pattern

Dashboard shows:

- status orientation
- Vouch card list
- next action
- bottom callout

Dashboard must not become:

- analytics dashboard
- marketplace feed
- messaging inbox
- review surface
- dispute panel
- kanban board
- provider discovery page

## Vouch Detail Pattern

Vouch detail is the canonical action surface.

It owns:

- payment status
- confirmation status
- checkout link sharing
- presence confirmation
- archive action
- role-aware next action
- safe timeline

Do not create route sprawl for sub-actions.

Use drawers or inline panels for protocol actions.

## Approved User-Facing Pages

Public:

```txt
/
/pricing
/faq
/legal/terms
/legal/privacy
/checkout/success
```

Auth:

```txt
/sign-in
/sign-up
```

Tenant:

```txt
/dashboard
/vouches/new
/vouches/new/confirm
/vouches/[vouchId]
```

External provider surfaces are not Vouch pages.

## Approved API Routes

Only provider webhook routes are allowed:

```txt
app/api/clerk/webhooks/route.ts
app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts
```

Internal app mutations must not use API routes.

Forbidden:

```txt
app/api/vouches/*
app/api/accounts/*
app/api/payment/setup/*
app/api/payout/setup/*
app/api/admin/*
```

## File Placement

Use these placements:

```txt
app/(tenant)/dashboard/page.tsx
features/dashboard/dashboard-page.tsx
features/dashboard/dashboard-page.client.tsx
components/dashboard/*

app/(tenant)/vouches/new/page.tsx
app/(tenant)/vouches/new/confirm/page.tsx
app/(tenant)/vouches/[vouchId]/page.tsx
features/vouches/*
components/vouches/*
components/forms/*

lib/actions/vouchActions.ts
lib/actions/paymentActions.ts
lib/actions/authActions.ts

lib/fetchers/vouchFetchers.ts
lib/fetchers/paymentFetchers.ts
lib/fetchers/authFetchers.ts
lib/fetchers/dashboardFetchers.ts

lib/db/selects/*
lib/db/transactions/*
lib/dto/*
lib/integrations/stripe/*
lib/auth/*
lib/authz/*
lib/vouch/*

schemas/*
types/*
```

## Design-System Rule

Every UI change must follow the Vouch design system:

- dark operational SaaS
- brutalist structure
- zero-radius panels
- high contrast
- black/neutral foundation
- restrained blue accent
- uppercase display typography
- dense intentional spacing
- bordered black/55 panels
- mobile-first layouts
- status text not color alone

Do not introduce soft consumer marketplace UI patterns.

## Forbidden Implementation Patterns

Do not implement:

- manual release button
- force refund button
- manual payout button
- admin outcome editor
- confirmation timestamp editor
- dispute form
- evidence upload
- review/rating UI
- marketplace cards
- provider search
- message thread
- public profiles
- service listings
- categories
- browse/search/discovery

## Validation Gates

Use scope-appropriate validation before reporting work complete.

Preferred full validation:

```txt
pnpm prisma:validate
pnpm validate:contracts
pnpm lint
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test
pnpm test:e2e
pnpm validate
pnpm validate:all
```

If a gate cannot be run, report:

- command not run
- reason it was not run
- expected risk
- exact user-run command needed

Do not claim validation passed unless the command actually passed.

## Completion Report

Final implementation report must contain only:

```txt
STATUS: COMPLETE | NOT COMPLETE

FILES DELIVERED:
- path
- path

VALIDATION:
- command: PASS | FAIL | NOT RUN

BLOCKERS:
- none
```
